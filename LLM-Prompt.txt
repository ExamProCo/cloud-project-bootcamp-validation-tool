Only provide the necessary response, please don't describe anything. Do you understand? yes or no?
---
I am going to provide you a Codeblock Critera and an AWS Architecture and the a following up question.
---
Codeblock Critera:
- Exclude code comments and empty lines.
- Exclude filters or values from the commands.
- Exclude any commands related to resource creation.
---
AWS Architecture:
- A custom VPC with three public subnets that route on to the internet, all AWS resources attempt to use this custom VPC
- An ECS Fargate cluster running a single service for the backend flask application
- The backend flask application container image is hosted in a private ECR repo
- The target services are using ECS Connect
- A custom domain name that is being managed by Route53
- An internet facing application load balancer is serving the backend flask application a subnet for the custom domain of api. The backend flask application runs on port 4567
- The target group for the backend flask application is performing health checks
- A CodePipeline for deploying code changes that is sourcing from Github
- The CodePipeline has a build step using CodeBuild to build a docker image and push it our private ECR repo for the backend-flask application container image
- An RDS Postgres server that is internet available in public subnets which is used by the backend flask application
- The CodePipline deploy steps uses ECS deployment not CodeDeploy
- A DynamoDB table that has a DynamoDB stream which triggers a lambda to write updates to the same DynamoDB table
- A Cognito User Pool used for authentication in our web-application, we have a post-configuration lambda webhook that inserts a new user into our RDS Postgres database
- We have a frontend react static website hosted on in an S3 bucket which is only accessible via a CloudFront distribution which redirects to HTTPS.
- The CloudFront distribution for the static website hosting is for both the www. And naked domain 
- The application load balancer, and cloudfront distributions all use HTTPS and is using a public certificate generated by Amazon Certification Manager
- Our application has profile photos which are uploaded client side, we do this by having an HTTP API Gateway endpoint which will point to a lambda that will generate out a presigned URL to bucket that will raw assets
- Our HTTP API Gateway uses a Lambda authorization for our Cognito User Pool
- In our HTTP API Gateway we use a proxy to a custom lambda to handle the CORS preflight check
- When new files are uploaded to the bucket holding raw assets this will trigger via S3 Event Notifications a lambda which will process the images into thumbnails and it will output the the images into another bucket which will called the assets buckets
- This assets bucket is only accessible via a cloudfront distribution that will server assets from the assets. subdomain
- Route53 is pointing the naked domain and www to the cloudfront distribution that servers that static frontend react application, where the api. Is serving the backend flask application where as the assets. Subdomain is serving the cloudfront distribution for the graphical assets

Please provide a single codeblock of AWS CLI commands for the provided AWS Architecture following the provided Codeblock Criteria
