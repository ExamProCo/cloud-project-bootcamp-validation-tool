# Instead of setting multiple environment variables for credentials, Google Cloud typically uses a single environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS that points to a JSON file containing your service account key.

#Create a Service Account and Key:
# - Go to the Google Cloud Console.
# - Navigate to IAM & Admin â†’ Service accounts.
# - Create a service account or select an existing one.
# - Generate a new private key for this service account (usually in JSON format).
# Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS Environment Variable:
# - After downloading the JSON key file, set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of this file.

# export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/workspace/cloud-project-bootcamp-validation-tool/gcp-service-account-key.json"
